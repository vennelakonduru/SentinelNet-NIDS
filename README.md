## Project Overview

In this project, I developed **SentinelNet**, an AI-powered Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) designed to detect malicious network traffic and cyber-attacks. The system uses machine learning and anomaly detection techniques to classify network traffic as normal or suspicious, and supports real-time intrusion detection with alert generation and logging.


## Goal of the Project

* Detect malicious network traffic using AI
* Classify traffic as normal or attack
* Analyze traffic patterns
* Reduce false alarms
* Generate alerts for suspicious activity



## Understanding the Core Problem

* Modern networks continuously exchange data
* Cyber-attacks can be hidden in this traffic
* Rule-based systems fail for unknown attacks
* Machine Learning helps detect hidden patterns
* Main task: **Traffic Classification (Normal vs Intrusion)**


## Key Outcomes

* Understood network traffic & attack types
* Applied machine learning models
* Performed feature engineering
* Implemented anomaly detection
* Generated alerts & logs
* Built end-to-end ML pipeline


##  Dataset Used

**NSL-KDD Dataset**
